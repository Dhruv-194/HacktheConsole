## About the Project :

In this world of the 21st century where we have various different types of heavy graphic based games be it single player or multiplayer, at times there is a sense of repetition which can make our experience boring and dull. At this time one needs a change and what better than playing some original basic 2048 or Minesweeper directly available on the terminal. 

### HacktheConsole is a gaming project which includes a launcher and 2 games - “2048 and Minesweeper” both of which run on terminal. 

### Domain we have worked on - GAMING

---

## Technologies/Language Used :

We used two oops language to create our project -

- Cpp to create the *"**run.cpp** launcher file"* : which when compiled and executed will run the exe files of the two games. 
- CSharp to create the console/terminal based games : **2048 and minesweeper**. 

--- 

## How to run the project : 

> - Fork and Clone this repository or Download it via zip 
> - Open the [run.cpp file](https://github.com/Dhruv-194/HacktheConsole/blob/master/Source/run.cpp) in any of your code editor. 
> - Then compile and execute the file. ( In most cases the project should run and you should be able to play the game ) 

### If any problem occurs : 

> If the project shows error that must have been because of the wrong location of the downloaded exe files. 
>  - Go to [line 27](https://github.com/Dhruv-194/HacktheConsole/blob/5ce54cab3c1dffb4532ffd73e6cd33d1834343d3/Source/run.cpp#L27) of the run.cpp file and put the exact local file location of [Console2048.exe](https://github.com/Dhruv-194/HacktheConsole/blob/master/Game/2048/Console2048.exe)
>  - Similarily go to [line 32](https://github.com/Dhruv-194/HacktheConsole/blob/5ce54cab3c1dffb4532ffd73e6cd33d1834343d3/Source/run.cpp#L32) of the run.cpp file and put the exact local file location of [Minesweeper.exe](https://github.com/Dhruv-194/HacktheConsole/blob/master/Game/Minesweeper/ConsoleMinesweep.exe)
