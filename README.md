# HacktheConsole

In this world of the 21st century where we have various different types of heavy graphic based games be it single player or multiplayer, at times there is a sense of repetition which can make our experience boring and dull. At this time one needs a change and what better than playing some original basic 2048 or Minesweeper directly available on the terminal. 

### HacktheConsole is a gaming project which includes a launcher and 2 games - “2048 and Minesweeper” both of which run on terminal.
