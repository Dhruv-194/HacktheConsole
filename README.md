# HacktheConsole

In this world of the 21st century where we have various different types of heavy graphic based games be it single player or multiplayer, at times there is a sense of repetition which can make our experience boring and dull. At this time one needs a change and what better than playing some original basic 2048 or Minesweeper directly available on the terminal. 

### HacktheConsole is a gaming project which includes a launcher and 2 games - “2048 and Minesweeper” both of which run on terminal. 

## Technologies/Language Used :

We used two oops language to create our project -

- Cpp to create the *"**run.cpp** launcher file"* : which when compiled and executed will run the exe files of the two games. 
- CSharp to create the console/terminal based games : **2048 and minesweeper**
